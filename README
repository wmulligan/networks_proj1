3) Send and receiving pictures.
4) Using MYSQL database for server.
5) Using Go Back N.
6) Sending Acks and using check sums.
7) 

Design Appendments:
1) Physical Layer uses a one byte header for length to seperate packets on the TCP stream.
2) Used Two Threads per layer.  One for send packets, one for receiving.
3) Length field in datalink packet was removed.
